    <p>The Puma is a German infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) 
      (Sch√ºtzenpanzer or short SPz) designed to replace the aging Marder 
      IFVs currently in service with the German Army. Production of the 
      first batch of 350 vehicles began in 2010 and was completed in 
      August 2021. A second batch of 229 Pumas received funding. <br><br>
      Mass production began on 6 July 2009.[9] The companies responsible for this project 
      are Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall Landsysteme, which created 
      a joint venture, Projekt System Management GmbH (PSM). The Puma is 
      one of the world's best-protected IFVs, while still having a high 
      power-to-weight ratio. <br><br>
      The Puma (formerly also named Igel (hedgehog) and Panther) started 
      as a follow-up project to the German 1996 "NGP" project (Neue 
      Gepanzerte Plattformen, "New Armored Platforms"). Its aim was to 
      collect ideas for a common base vehicle that could be used for a 
      variety of tasks including that of the APC, IFV, air defense and 
      replacing and assisting the MBT in the frontline combat role. The 
      NGP project was ended in 2001.
