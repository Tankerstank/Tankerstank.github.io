    <p>The Tiger I was a German heavy tank of World War II that 
      operated beginning in 1942 in Africa and in the Soviet Union, 
      usually in independent heavy tank battalions. It gave the German 
      Army its first armoured fighting vehicle that mounted the 8.8 cm 
      KwK 36 gun (derived from the 8.8 cm Flak 36). 1,347 were built 
      between August 1942 and August 1944. After August 1944, 
      production of the Tiger I was phased out in favour of the 
      Tiger II. <br><br>

      While the Tiger I has been called an outstanding design for its time,
      it has also been called overengineered, using expensive materials and 
      labour-intensive production methods. In the early period, the Tiger was 
      prone to certain types of track failures and breakdowns. It was expensive 
      to maintain, but generally mechanically reliable. It was difficult to 
      transport and vulnerable to immobilisation when mud, ice, and snow froze 
      between its overlapping and interleaved Schachtellaufwerk-pattern road 
      wheels, often jamming them solid. This was a problem on the Eastern 
      Front in the muddy rasputitsa season and during periods of extreme cold.<br><br>

      Today, only nine Tiger I tanks survive in museums and private collections worldwide. 
      As of 2021, Tiger 131 (captured during the North Africa Campaign) at the UK's Tank 
      Museum is the only example restored to running order. <br><br>
