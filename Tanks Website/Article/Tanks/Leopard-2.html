    <p>The Leopard 2 is a third generation German main battle tank (MBT). 
      Developed by Krauss-Maffei in the 1970s, the tank entered service in 
      1979 and replaced the earlier Leopard 1 as the main battle tank of the 
      West German army. Various iterations of the Leopard 2 continue to be 
      operated by the armed forces of Germany, as well as 13 other European 
      countries, and several non-European countries, including Canada, Chile, 
      Indonesia, and Singapore. Some operating countries have licensed the 
      Leopard 2 design for local production and domestic development. <br><br>
      There are two main development tranches of the Leopard 2. The first encompasses 
      tanks produced up to the Leopard 2A4 standard and are characterised by their 
      vertically faced turret armour. The second tranche, from Leopard 2A5 onwards, 
      has an angled, arrow-shaped, turret appliqu√© armour, together with other 
      improvements. The main armament of all Leopard 2 tanks is a smoothbore 120 mm 
      cannon made by Rheinmetall. This is operated with a digital fire control system, 
      laser rangefinder, and advanced night vision and sighting equipment. The tank is
      powered by a V12 twin-turbo diesel engine made by MTU Friedrichshafen. <br><br>
      In the 1990s, the Leopard 2 was used by the German Army on peacekeeping operations 
      in Kosovo. In the 2000s, Dutch, Danish and Canadian forces deployed their Leopard 2 
      tanks in the War in Afghanistan as part of their contribution to the International 
      Security Assistance Force. In the 2010s, Turkish Leopard 2 tanks saw action in 
      Syria. In 2023, Ukrainian Leopard 2 tanks saw action in the Russo-Ukrainian War.
