    <p>The AMX-13 is a French light tank produced from 1952 to 1987. 
      It served with the French Army, as the Char 13t-75 Modèle 51, 
      and was exported to more than 26 other nations. Named after its 
      initial weight of 13 tonnes, and featuring a tough and reliable 
      chassis, it was fitted with an oscillating turret built by GIAT 
      Industries (now Nexter) with revolver type magazines, which were 
      also used on the Austrian SK-105 Kürassier. Including prototypes 
      and export versions, over a hundred variants exist, including 
      self-propelled guns, anti-aircraft systems, APCs, and ATGM versions.
