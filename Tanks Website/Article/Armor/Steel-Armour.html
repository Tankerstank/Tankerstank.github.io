    <img src='../../Image/Steel-Armour.png'>
    <p>Rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) is a type of vehicle armour made 
      of a single steel composition hot-rolled to improve its material 
      characteristics, as opposed to layered or cemented armour. Its first
      common application was in tanks. After World War II, it began to fall 
      out of use on main battle tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles 
      intended to see front-line combat as new anti-tank weapon technologies 
      were developed which were capable of relatively easily penetrating 
      rolled homogeneous armour plating even of significant thickness. <br><br>
      Today, the term is primarily used as a unit of measurement of the 
      protection offered by armour on a vehicle (often composed of 
      materials that may not actually contain steel, or even contain 
      any metals) in equivalent millimetres of RHA, referring to the 
      thickness of RHA that would provide the same protection. Typically, 
      modern composite armour can provide the same amount of protection 
      with much thinner and lighter construction than its protective 
      equivalence in RHA. Likewise, the term is also used as a unit of 
      measurement of penetration capability of armour-piercing weaponry, 
      in terms of the millimetres of RHA that the weapon system can 
      reliably penetrate. <br><br>
