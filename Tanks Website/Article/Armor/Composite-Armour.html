    <p>Composite armour is a type of vehicle armour consisting of layers of 
      different materials such as metals, plastics, ceramics or air. Most 
      composite armours are lighter than their all-metal equivalent, but 
      instead occupy a larger volume for the same resistance to penetration.
      It is possible to design composite armour stronger, lighter and less 
      voluminous than traditional armour, but the cost is often prohibitively 
      high, restricting its use to especially vulnerable parts of a vehicle. 
      Its primary purpose is to help defeat high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) 
      projectiles. <br><br>
      
      HEAT had posed a serious threat to armoured vehicles since its 
      introduction in World War II. Lightweight and small, HEAT projectiles 
      could nevertheless penetrate hundreds of millimetres of the most 
      resistant steel armours. The capability of most materials for defeating 
      HEAT follows the "density law", which states that the penetration of
      shaped charge jets is proportional to the square root of the shaped 
      charge liner density (typically copper) divided by the square root of 
      the target density. On a weight basis, lighter targets are more 
      advantageous than heavier targets, but using large quantities of 
      lightweight materials has obvious disadvantages in terms of mechanical 
      layout. Certain materials have an optimal compromise in terms of 
      density that makes them particularly useful in this role.
