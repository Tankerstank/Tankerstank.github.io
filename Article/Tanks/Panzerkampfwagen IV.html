    <p> The Panzerkampfwagen IV (Pz.Kpfw. IV), commonly known as the Panzer IV, was a 
      German medium tank developed in the late 1930s and used extensively during the 
      Second World War. Its ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 161.<br><br>
      The Panzer IV saw service in all combat theatres involving Germany and was the 
      only German tank to remain in continuous production throughout the war. It was 
      originally designed for infantry support, while the similar Panzer III was to 
      fight armoured fighting vehicles. <br><br>
      However, as the Germans faced the formidable T-34, the Panzer IV had more 
      development potential, with a larger turret ring to mount more powerful guns, 
      so it swapped roles with the Panzer III whose production wound down in 1943. <br><br>
      The Panzer IV received various upgrades and design modifications, intended to counter 
      new threats, extending its service life. Generally, these involved increasing the armour 
      protection or upgrading the weapons, although during the last months of the war, 
      with Germany's pressing need for rapid replacement of losses, design changes also 
      included simplifications to speed up the manufacturing process.
