    <p>The M1 Abrams is a third-generation American main battle tank designed by 
      Chrysler Defense (Now General Dynamics Land Systems) and named for General 
      Creighton Abrams. Conceived for modern armored ground warfare and now one of the 
      heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 short tons (62 metric tons), it introduced 
      several modern technologies to US armored forces, including a multifuel turbine 
      engine, sophisticated Chobham composite armor, a computer fire control system, 
      separate ammunition storage in a blowout compartment, and NBC protection for 
      crew safety. Initial models of the M1 were armed with a 105 mm M68 gun, while 
      later variants feature a license-produced Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44 designated M256. <br><br>
      The M1 Abrams was developed from the failed MBT-70 project that intended to replace the 
      obsolete M60 tank. There are three main operational Abrams versions, the M1, M1A1, and 
      M1A2, with each new iteration seeing improvements in armament, protection, and electronics. <br><br>
      The Abrams was to be replaced in U.S. Army service by the XM1202 Mounted Combat System, but since 
      that project was cancelled, the Army has opted to continue maintaining and operating the M1 
      series for the foreseeable future by upgrading with improved optics, armor, and firepower. <br><br>
      The M1 Abrams entered service in 1980 and serves as the main battle tank of the United States Army 
      and formerly of the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The export version is used by the armies of 
      Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Poland and Iraq. The Abrams was first used in combat in the 
      Gulf War and has seen combat in both the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War under U.S. service, while 
      Iraqi Abrams tanks have seen action in the war against the Islamic State and have seen use by Saudi 
      Arabia during the Yemeni Civil War.
