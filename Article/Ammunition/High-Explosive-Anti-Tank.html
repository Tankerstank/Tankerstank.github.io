      High-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) is the effect of a shaped charge explosive that uses 
      the Munroe effect to penetrate heavy armor. The warhead functions by having an 
      explosive charge collapse a metal liner inside the warhead into a high-velocity shaped 
      charge jet; this is capable of penetrating armor steel to a depth of seven or more 
      times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD). The shaped charge jet armor 
      penetration effect is purely kinetic in nature; the round has no explosive or 
      incendiary effect on the armor. <br><br>

      As they rely on the kinetic energy of the shaped charge jet for their penetration 
      performance, HEAT warheads do not have to be delivered with high velocity, as an 
      armor-piercing round does. Thus they can be fired by lower-powered weapons that 
      generate less recoil. The performance of HEAT weapons has nothing to do with thermal 
      effects, with HEAT being simply an acronym.
