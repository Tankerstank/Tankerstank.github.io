      Armour-piercing, capped, ballistic capped (APCBC) is a type of 
      configuration for armour-piercing ammunition introduced in the 
      1930s to improve the armour-piercing capabilities of both naval 
      and anti-tank guns. The configuration consists of an 
      armour-piercing shell fitted with a stubby armour-piercing cap 
      (AP cap) for improved penetration properties against surface 
      hardened armour, especially at high impact angles, and an 
      aerodynamic ballistic cap on top of the AP cap to correct for the 
      poorer aerodynamics, especially higher drag, otherwise created by 
      the stubby AP cap. These features allow APCBC shells to retain 
      higher velocities and to deliver more energy to the target on 
      impact, especially at long range when compared to uncapped shells.
