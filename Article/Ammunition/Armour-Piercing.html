      Armour-piercing ammunition (AP) is a type of projectile 
      designed to penetrate either body armour or vehicle armour.
      The first major application of armour-piercing projectiles 
      was to defeat the thick armour carried on many warships and 
      cause damage to their lightly armoured interiors. <br><br>
      From the 1920s onwards, armour-piercing weapons were required 
      for anti-tank warfare. AP rounds smaller than 20 mm are intended
      for lightly armoured targets such as body armour, bulletproof 
      glass, and lightly armoured vehicles. <br><br>
      As tank armour improved during World War II, anti-vehicle rounds 
      began to use a smaller but dense penetrating body within a larger 
      shell, firing at very high muzzle velocity. Modern penetrators are 
      long rods of dense material like tungsten or depleted uranium (DU) 
      that further improve the terminal ballistics.
