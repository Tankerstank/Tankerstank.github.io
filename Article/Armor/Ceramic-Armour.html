    <p>Ceramic's precise mechanism for defeating HEAT was uncovered in 
      the 1980s. High speed photography showed that the ceramic material 
      shatters as the HEAT round penetrates, the highly energetic 
      fragments destroying the geometry of the metal jet generated by 
      the hollow charge, greatly diminishing the penetration. Ceramic 
      layers can also be used as part of composite armour solutions. 
      The high hardness of some ceramic materials serves as a disruptor 
      that shatters and spreads the kinetic energy of projectiles.
